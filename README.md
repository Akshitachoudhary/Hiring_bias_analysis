# Hiring Bias Analysis – Resume Screening

## Project Overview
This project analyzes potential bias in automated resume screening systems, focusing on keyword based bias and education level bias.

The goal is to understand whether resume screening scores are influenced more by surface level signals such as skill keyword volume and academic qualifications rather than job relevance.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Power BI
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Analysis Steps
- Cleaned and normalized resume and skill data
- Engineered features such as total skill count and skill count buckets
- Analyzed the relationship between skill count and screening score
- Evaluated education level influence on screening outcomes
- Built a one page Power BI dashboard to communicate insights

## Key Insights
- Resumes with higher skill keyword counts consistently received higher screening scores
- Screening scores increased with academic degree level, with PhD and Masters candidates scoring higher on average
- Nearly 47 percent of resumes received high screening scores, indicating possible score inflation
- Results suggest potential keyword quantity bias and education based bias in resume screening systems
